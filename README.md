To implement Machine learning Models on Existing data set and new data set 


Can compare the different machine learning Models

Main Hypothesis:

#1. To predict the RUL as a combination of features such as Charging time , Minimum 
voltage Charge(v), Maximum Voltage Discharge(v) from the above data set.


#2. Can estimate the relationship of RUL to Charging time, Minimum voltage Charge(v), 
Maximum Voltage Discharge(v) 


#3. Can prepare new data set from original to include temperature and other additional 
different batteries across different university records such as oxford, CALCE through 
Reference #4 link and predict the RUL. (Total records can increase to approximately 
20,000)

#4. Compare the different Machine Learning Models
